0. Description
--------------
This file includes the installation and building instructions of the citenet/CNA
package.

1. Installation
---------------
If you obtained the citenet package as an individual package (ie not from CRAN),
the packages it depends on need to be installed first before proceeding to
install the actual citenet package.

1.1. Installation of the required packages
------------------------------------------
citenet depends on the following packages of the CRAN repository:
* RSQLite
* sna
* igraph
* network

They can be installed from within R by using the 'install.packages()' command,
provided you have internet access:

> install.packages(c("RSQLite", "sna", "igraph", "network"))

Alternatively, on GNU/Linux systems some of the packages might be available to
be installed using your system's standard package manager. Please refer to
your distribution's documentation if that is the case.

1.2. Installation of the citenet package
------------------------------------
The citenet package is available both as a source package, and as a binary
package.
* Source package: cna_0.3-5.tar.gz 
* Binary package: cna_0.3-5.zip

1.2.1. Installing from source package
-------------------------------------
This is the preferred method of installation on Unix-based systems. On such
systems, the package can be installed from the command line or from the R
environment.

From the command line:
$ R CMD install -l /path/to/library cna_0.3-5.tar.gz

From the R command line:
> install.packages("cna_0.3-5.tar.gz")

Note that on Windows systems, the default behaviour of "install.packages()" is
different that the one on GNU/Linux systems. In particular, if you install the
source package from the R command line, you need to explicitly specify that
it is a source package:

> install.packages("cna_0.3-5.tar.gz", type="source", repos=NULL)

1.2.2. Installing from binary package
-------------------------------------
This is the preferred method of installation on Windows-based systems. On such
systems, the package can be installed from the R command line or by using the
GUI (Rgui).

From the R command line:
> install.packages("c:/r/pkg/cna_0.3-5.zip")

From the GUI:
By clicking on the "Packages" menu, selecting "Install package(s) from local
zip files", and selecting the "cna_0.3-5.zip" filename.


2. Building
-----------
While the package does not include native source code and no compilation is
necessary, in this section information is provided regarding the packaging
under different systems and configurations.

2.1. GNU/Linux systems
----------------------
On GNU/Linux system, the package can be generated by running the standard
"R CMD build" command under the correct directory. Most distributions come
with the default GNU tools installed (tar, gzip, etc): if this is not the case,
please refer to your system's documentation in order to install them.

From the folder that contains the "citenet" subfolder:
$ R CMD build citenet

The binary package for the system's arquitecture can be generated by using
the "--binary" flag:
$ R CMD INSTALL citenet --build

2.2 Windows systems
-------------------
On Windows systems, it is required that Rtools are installed, as they provide
the tools that mimic the GNU tools required. The Rtools can be downloaded from:

http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/

Once they are installed, they need to be added to the system's path in order 
to make sure that R is able to locate them. This document assumes that R is 
installed on the directory:

C:\Program Files\R\R-2.12.1

and the RTools are installed on:

C:\Rtools

It also asumes that the 'citenet' folder is stored under

C:\temp

From a command prompt, the following command will set up the right PATH:

> set PATH=c:\Program Files\R\R-2.12.1\bin;C:\Rtools\bin;%PATH%

From the same command prompt window, the following command can be used to
generate the package:

c:\temp> R CMD INSTALL citenet --build
